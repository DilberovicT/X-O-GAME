-XO game-
XO is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid board. Each player selects a symbol - one plays with "X" and the other with "O". The objective of the game is to place three of the same symbols in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally - on the board. Players take turns making their moves by placing their symbols on empty squares of the board. The game continues until one player achieves victory or until the board is filled, resulting in a draw. XO is a simple yet engaging game that tests players' strategy and tactics while also providing an opportunity for enjoyment and fun in social settings.
